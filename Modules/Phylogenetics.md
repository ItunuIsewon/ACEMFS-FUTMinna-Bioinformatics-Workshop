You have been provided with a fasta file called **Aspergillus18S.fasta** and **Yeast18S.fasta**

### ðŸ“¥ **Dataset:** Download the file for Aspergillus18S [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/198xN18mfp4nXMt5clEkke5q0jDkK3U5X/view?usp=sharing)

Download the file for Yeast18S.fasta [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sHnZbJOcKqs4mpDHCKBxPkUNNkF8-zLF/view?usp=drive_link)
**
**Step 1: Import sequences into MEGA **

1. Launch MEGA X. 
2. File â†’ Open a File/Sessionâ€¦ â†’ select Aspergillus18S.fasta. 
3. When prompted, choose Align. 
4. MEGA opens the Alignment Explorer showing your unaligned sequences.
    
**Step 2 â€” Multiple Sequence Alignment (ClustalW)**

In Alignment Explorer: 
1. Align â†’ Align by ClustalW . 
2. Click Options and set/confirm the parameters below, then Compute.

After alignment: 
â€¢ Scroll through; 18S has conserved stems and variable loopsâ€”expect gaps mostly in variable regions. 
â€¢ If the first/last ~10â€“30 bases are gappy, select and Edit â†’ Delete Selected Sites (or Mask), so they donâ€™t add noise. 

Save the alignment: Data â†’ Export Alignment â†’ MEGA format (.meg) and also FASTA 
for records. 
 
**Step 3 â€” Build a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree **
1. Close Alignment Explorer (save when prompted). 
2. In the main MEGA window, choose Phylogeny â†’ Construct/Test Neighbor
Joining Tree. 
3. In Analysis Preferences (the panel like your screenshot), set: 
Analysis 
â€¢ Scope â†’ All Selected Taxa (or choose a subset beforehand). 
â€¢ Statistical Method â†’ Neighbor-joining. 
Phylogeny Test (support) 
â€¢ Test of Phylogeny â†’ Bootstrap method. 
â€¢ No. of Bootstrap Replications â†’ 1000. 
Rule of thumb: â‰¥70% = moderate support, â‰¥90% = strong. 
Substitution Model (Distances) 
â€¢ Substitutions Type â†’ Nucleotide. 
â€¢ Model/Method â†’ Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL). 
Alternatives: Tamura-Nei (TN93) or Kimura 2-parameter (K2P); try these if you 
want sensitivity analysis. 
â€¢ Substitutions to Include â†’ d: Transitions + Transversions (include both). 
Rates and Patterns 
â€¢ Rates among Sites â†’ Uniform Rates (appropriate for conserved 18S). 
If analyzing more variable loci (e.g., ITS), consider Gamma Distributed; MEGA will 
estimate the shape (Î±). 
â€¢ Pattern among Lineages â†’ Same (Homogeneous). 
Data Subset to Use 
â€¢ Gaps/Missing Data â†’ Pairwise deletion (keeps more sites; good for rRNA with 
localized gaps). 
Complete deletion is stricter but can remove lots of signal. 
â€¢ Select Codon Positions â†’ Tick Noncoding Sites (coding positions have no effect 
for 18S). 
4. Click Compute to infer the NJ tree.
   
**Step 4 â€” Inspect, root, and annotate **

â€¢ Rooting: If your file contains a clear outgroup (e.g., a non-Aspergillus fungus), Tree 
Explorer â†’ Tree â†’ Root on that taxon. If not, use Midpoint rooting. 
â€¢ Show bootstrap values: In Tree Explorer, View â†’ Display Option â†’ Show â†’ 
Bootstrap values. 
â€¢ Tidy labels: Edit â†’ Replace tip labels can shorten long headers; you kept 
accession+species, which is perfect. 
â€¢ Collapse weak nodes: Optionally collapse branches with support <50â€“70% to 
simplify. 

**Step 5 â€” Export & document **

â€¢ File â†’ Export Current Tree (Newick) â†’ Aspergillus18S_NJ.nwk. 
â€¢ Image export: File â†’ Export Image (PNG/PDF/SVG) at 300â€“600 dpi. 
â€¢ Save your .meg project so you can reopen without re-aligning. 
Now try to repeat this process using the yeast18S.fasta
